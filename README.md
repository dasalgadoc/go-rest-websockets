## üìï Library considerations:

This repository explores Rest API and WebSockets using these libraries.

```bash
go get github.com/gorilla/mux 
go get github.com/gorilla/websocket
```

Despite, I already used Gin in [Solid Example](https://github.com/dasalgadoc/solid-example-go), I decided to use the Gorilla alternatives without knowing these libraries
was marked as archived at the end of 2022.

I won't change this repository to use others libraries, but I will link some alternatives:

- ‚≠êÔ∏è [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/)
- [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/)
- [Chi](https://go-chi.io/#/) 
- [Goji](https://goji.io/)

For websockets
